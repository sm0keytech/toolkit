So, this involves enumerating and then identifying how we could crack a password, thru a reset.
Here are the options:

Predictable Tokens: If the reset tokens used in links or SMS messages are predictable or follow a sequential pattern, attackers might guess or brute-force their way to generate valid reset URLs.
Token Expiration Issues: Tokens that remain valid for too long or do not expire immediately after use provide a window of opportunity for attackers. It’s crucial that tokens expire swiftly to limit this window.
Insufficient Validation: The mechanisms for verifying a user’s identity, like security questions or email-based authentication, might be weak and susceptible to exploitation if the questions are too common or the email account is compromised.
Information Disclosure: Any error message that specifies whether an email address or username is registered can inadvertently help attackers in their enumeration efforts, confirming the existence of accounts.
Insecure Transport: The transmission of reset links or tokens over non-HTTPS connections can expose these critical elements to interception by network eavesdroppers.
