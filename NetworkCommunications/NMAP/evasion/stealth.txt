-sS is the stealth scan which sends ack packets. requries nmap with sudo
privileges. super useful and gets past a lot of hassle within firewalls.

-Pn stops host enumeration (stops nmap from pinging the host / ports) 
since some intrusion prevention systems are trained to drop ICMP echo
requests (ping) and other host discovery probes (eg TCP or UDP). Pn skips
checking if host is alive, which is useful for bypassing the ping filter
but in turn can make scans a bit longer.
