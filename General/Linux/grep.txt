Usually, using the following is decent:

grep -i "whatever you need to find"
the -i flag makes it so nothing is case sensitive, which i always tend
to do.

if you need more context, there are a few ways to do it, but i always 
tend to lean towards:

grep -i "something you need" -A10 -B5

-A = after, number specifies however many lines.
-B = before, number again specifies however many lines.

normal format for grepping anything is:
cat something.txt | grep -i "something" -A5 -B5
