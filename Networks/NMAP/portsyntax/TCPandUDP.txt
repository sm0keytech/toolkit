TCP SYN Ping
if you wanna use it, do the following:
-PS followed by port number, range, list or a combination of them.
nmap -PS -sn machine_ip/24

TCP ACK Ping
This sends ACK packets, similar to SYN ping, where you need 
-PA followed by port num, range, list or combo of them.
nmap -PA80,443,8080 (same syntax for above)
can also use the 
nmap -PA -sn machine_ip/24

TCP Maimon Scan
-sM flag.
Most target systems respond with an RST packet regardless of whether the TCP port is open. In such a case, we won’t be able to discover the open ports. The figure below shows the expected behaviour in the cases of both open and closed TCP ports.
The console output below is an example of a TCP Maimon scan against a Linux server. As mentioned, because open ports and closed ports are behaving the same way, the Maimon scan could not discover any open ports on the target system.

TCP Window Scan
-sW
Another similar scan is the TCP window scan. The TCP window scan is almost the same as the ACK scan; however, it examines the TCP Window field of the RST packets returned. On specific systems, this can reveal that the port is open. You can select this scan type with the option -sW. As shown in the figure below, we expect to get an RST packet in reply to our “uninvited” ACK packets, regardless of whether the port is open or closed.

UDP Ping
we can use UDP to discover if the host is online
nmap -PU -sn target
