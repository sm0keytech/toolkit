so this took me a while but was so rewarding.

sign into oracle, make the account, etc.
use the link from the email to sign in, it is fucky but what can you do when its free.

get in, now we want to open a port so we can send our results back to our lovely server for further examination + we'd actually do this in a red team excercise.
MAKE SURE YOU SAVE THE SSH KEY FROM THE SETUP OTHERWISE YOU ARE COOKED


ssh into da machine, we now have our lovely server setup.
firstly, we also wanna go onto the website, check the instance, note the ip all the good stuff

when thats done, we are now wanting to open a port. navigate to the following:
three lines top left --> virtual cloud networks --> click the active one which is highlighted --> scroll down until you see security lists -->
click blue highlighted "default security lists" --> add an ingress rule --> source port range should be all, destination port should be whatever you want,
i chose 8080 but could be whatever within reason --> source CIDR should be 0.0.0.0/0 to allow all IPs --> leave everything else default and save changes.

now, within the machine, we need to configure the software firewall. do the following:

sudo apt install firewalld
sudo firewall-cmd --zone=public --permanent --add-port=8080/tcp < change port to whatever is needed
sudo firewall-cmd --reload
python3 -m http.server 8080 < start your http server to recieve what we need!
