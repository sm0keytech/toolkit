AD persistence can be a pain to defend against. In certain cases, the persistence can be so deeply rooted that a complete domain rebuild is required. However, there are a couple of things that we can do to detect deployed persistence:

Anomalous account logon events are the most common alert for persistence. Any time credentials break the tiering model, it can be as a result of persistence.
For each of the persistence techniques mentioned, specific detection rules can be written, such as cases when a machine account's password changes, ACLs are permissively updated, or new GPOs are created.
The best defence against persistence is to protect privileged resources. Although low privileged access can be used to deploy persistence, the truly scary techniques only become available once an attacker has acquired privileged access to the domain.
