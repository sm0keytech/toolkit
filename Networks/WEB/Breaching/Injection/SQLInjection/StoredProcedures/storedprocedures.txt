Exploiting Stored Procedures

Stored procedures are routines stored in the database that can perform various operations, such as inserting, updating, or querying data.
While stored procedures can help improve performance and ensure consistency, they can also be vulnerable to SQL injection if not properly handled.

Stored procedures are precompiled SQL statements that can be executed as a single unit. 
They are stored in the database and can be called by applications to perform specific tasks.
Stored procedures can accept parameters, which can make them flexible and powerful.
However, if these parameters are not properly sanitised, they can introduce SQL injection vulnerabilities.

Consider a stored procedure designed to retrieve user data based on a username:
CREATE PROCEDURE sp_getUserData
    @username NVARCHAR(50)
AS
BEGIN
    DECLARE @sql NVARCHAR(4000)
    SET @sql = 'SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = ''' + @username + ''''
    EXEC(@sql)
END

In this example, the stored procedure concatenates the @username parameter into a dynamic SQL query. This approach is vulnerable to SQL injection because the input is not sanitised.
