hide a scan with decoys you want (ip addresses):
nmap -D DECOY_IP1,DECOY_IP2,ME


hide a scan with random ip addresses:
nmap -D RND,RND,ME

use a HTTP/SOCKS4 proxy to relay connections:
nmap --proxies PROXY_URL
(proxy url is an ip address for a proxy server)

spoof MAC address: 
nmap --spoof-mac MAC_ADDRESS 
(only works if you are in the same network segment, sharing the same ethernet.)
if you are on the same ethernet, you can do this to bypass the trust policies.


spoof a source IP addres:
nmap -S ip_addr

use a specific source port number:
nmap -g PORT-NUM or nmap --source-port PORT-NUM
