Just a database and a database viewer for when you find a database and
need a specific thing to view it. Think the file extension for this is

.kdbx

Just go online and install the AppImage, then once thats done, go ahead 
and chmod +x it to make it an executable, then execute it and its nice 
and installed for you to view your database loot.
