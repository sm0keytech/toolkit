Malicious Security Support Provider (SSP)
Exploiting the SSP interface, it is possible to add new SSPs. We can add Mimikatz's mimilib as an SSP that would log all credentials of authentication attempts to a file. We can specify a network location for logging, which would allow mimilib to send us credentials as users authenticate to the compromised host, providing persistence.
