Here, we are doing what the title says.

Here is an insecure token issue where the token is generated at a value between 100 and 200.
$token = mt_rand(100, 200);
$query = $conn->prepare("UPDATE users SET reset_token = ? WHERE email = ?");
$query->bind_param("ss", $token, $email);
$query->execute();

The code above sets a random three-digit PIN as the reset token of the submitted email. Since this token doesn't employ mixed characters, it can be easily brute-forced.

Youll see the request inside of burp suite with proper enum. Use this, add the payload to the correct spot into burp suite, then 
hack it into working.
