The following are some of the types of clear-text files that an attacker may be interested in:

Commands history
Configuration files (Web App, FTP files, etc.)
Other Files related to Windows Applications (Internet Browsers, Email Clients, etc.)
Backup files
Shared files and folders
Registry
Source code 

Executed powershell commands history file:
C:\Users\USER\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Windows\PowerShell\PSReadLine\ConsoleHost_history.txt

Finding the word "password" within the window registry:
reg query HKLM /f password /t REG_SZ /s
#OR
reg query HKCU /f password /t REG_SZ /s

Database files are extremely useful because you can download them and then
try to get into the database. Use correct tools such as keepass, covered
inside of the breaching section inside of the AD folder of this repo.

Password managers can withhold flaws that can be exploited to extract
data.

Memory dump can be extremely useful, we can find things such as:
Cleartext credentials
Cached passwords
AD tickets.

Active directory can have some misconfigurations that can lead to being 
able to leak credentials. This includes:

NTDS: Contains AD users' credentials, making it a target for attackers.
Group Policy SYSVOL: Leaked encryption keys let attackers access administrator accounts. Check Task 8 for more information about the vulnerable version of SYSVOL.
Users' description: Administrators set a password in the description for new employees and leave it there, which makes the account vulnerable to unauthorized access. 
AD Attacks: Misconfiguration makes AD vulnerable to various attacks

Network sniffing can also be used to attempt to find credentials.
