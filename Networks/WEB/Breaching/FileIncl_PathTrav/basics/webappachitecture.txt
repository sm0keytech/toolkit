Structure of a Web Application

Web applications are complex systems comprising several components working together to deliver a seamless user experience. At its core, a web application has two main parts: the frontend and the backend.

Frontend: This is the user interface of the application, typically built using frameworks like React, Angular, or Vue.js. It communicates with the backend via APIs.

Backend: This server-side component processes user requests, interacts with databases, and serves data to the frontend. It's often developed using languages like PHP, Python, and Javascript and frameworks like Node.js, Django, or Laravel.

One of the fundamental aspects of web applications is the client-server model. In this model, the client, usually a web browser, sends a request to the server hosting the web application. The backend server then processes this request and sends back a response. The client and server communication usually happens over the HTTP/HTTPS protocols.

Server-Side Scripting and File Handling
Server-side scripts run on the server and generate the content of the frontend, which is then sent to the client. Unlike client-side scripts like JavaScript in the browser, server-side scripts can access the server's file system and databases. File handling is a significant part of server-side scripting. Web applications often need to read from or write to files on the server. For example, reading configuration files, saving user uploads, or including code from other files.

For example, the application below includes a file based on user input. 

If this input is not correctly validated and sanitized, an attacker might exploit the vulnerable parameter to include malicious files or access sensitive files on the server. In this case, the attacker could view the contents of the server's passwd file.

In short, file inclusion and path traversal vulnerabilities arise when user inputs are not properly sanitized or validated. Since attackers can inject malicious payloads to log files /var/log/apache2/access.log and manipulate file paths to execute the logged payload, an attacker can achieve remote code execution. An attacker may also read configuration files that contain sensitive information, like database credentials, if the application returns the file in plaintext. Lastly, insufficient error handling may also reveal system paths or file structures, providing clues to attackers about potential targets for path traversal or file inclusion attacks.
