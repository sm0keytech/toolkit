You need relevant admin permissions to do this, however its usually pretty
nice, here we are using runas to inject our credentials into memory:

Usually, you want to compromise an administrator account with more 
permissions such as a server admin's account in order to get the gpo editor,
then inject their credentials into memory (in the AD username part below)
and then pop in to edit the gpo

runas /netonly /user:za.tryhackme.loc\<AD Username> cmd.exe

dir \\za.tryhackme.loc\sysvol -- checks if you have access

then simply open mmc:

mmc
