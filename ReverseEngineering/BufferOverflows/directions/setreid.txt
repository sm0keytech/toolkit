You can also add things from something like pwntools where we could generate shellcode in order to give us more control over what we can do wtihin a binary.
For example, within the binary I am currently working with, I am doing something named setreuid. I'm using this to interpret myself as someone else, 
I think this is a pretty basic privesc vector.

For this, we can use pwntools, a pretty decent repo containing a lot of different really decent tools for us.
apt-get update
apt-get install python3 python3-pip python3-dev git libssl-dev libffi-dev build-essential
python3 -m pip install --upgrade pip
python3 -m pip install --upgrade pwntools

pip is a bitch on linux sometimes so you can just use pipx instead, i did this run cause it wouldnt work and i didnt wanna break my 
apt package manager

Then, the command:
pwn shellcraft -f d amd64.linux.setreuid 1002

pwn - application

shellcraft - subcommand which means we are crafting shellcode 

-f file type d for decimal (or binary)

amd64.linux.setreuid - tells it to generate shellcode for amd64 linux and generate the system call for setreuid so i can set us to user 1002

1002 is the user id of user 2 on this system!
