Computer Accounts

The passwords for machine accounts are normally rotated every 30 days. However, we can alter the password of a machine account which would stop the automatic rotation. Together with this, we can grant the machine account administrative access to other machines. This will allow us to use the computer account as a normal account, with the only sign of the persistence being the fact that the account has administrative rights over other hosts, which is often normal behaviour in AD, so that it may go undetected.
