Local File Inclusion
Local File Inclusion, or LFI, typically occurs when an attacker exploits vulnerable input fields to access or execute files on the server. Attackers usually exploit poorly sanitized input fields to manipulate file paths, aiming to access files outside the intended directory. For example, using a traversal string, an attacker might access sensitive files like include.php?page=../../../../etc/passwd.
While LFI primarily leads to unauthorized file access, it can escalate to RCE. This can occur if the attacker can upload or inject executable code into a file that is later included or executed by the server. Techniques such as log poisoning, which means injecting code into log files and then including those log files, are examples of how LFI can lead to RCE.
