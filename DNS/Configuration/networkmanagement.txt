Network manager -> Advanced Network Configuration -> Your connection -> ipv4 settings 

Set the DNS here to the THM Domain Controller DNS (THMDC usually)

Add another DNS such as 1.1.1.1 or 8.8.8.8 so you still have internet access

Then run sudo systemctl restart NetworkManager

Then, hardcode some DNS management into /etc/hosts file within kali sys

You can also get into the network manager by just doing command:
sudo nm-connection-editor

Then, double down by going into 
sudo nano /etc/resolv.conf
and adding the addresses into there to ensure they can be resolved.

make sure after all steps are complete to run the restart nm command above
