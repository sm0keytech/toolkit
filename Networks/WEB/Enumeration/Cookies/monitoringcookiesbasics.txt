So, for this, we usually do it within kali firefox.
The 2 main places are:

Storage > Cookies
For editing values, changing, removing and adding cookies.

The next place is inside the network tab, where we monitor the network traffic, and see the cookies coming and going.


For the basics, you will be looking for the following:
When cookies need authentication for a website.
Looking at those session cookies. Looking at expiry dates, paths, attempting to decode them, etc.

We can check for whether a cookie has been terminated using the following:
Client-side, we can easily check by logging in and out. Before we log out, keep the cookie. Then, re-authenticate, and replace your new
cookie with the old cookie value. This will check whether the serverside has deleted your cookie.

If you get an error 500, meaning an internal server error, it means that the cookie termination is working, but there is something wrong, as an
invalid session should not lead to an internal server error.

We can also check the local storage section within the storage, and play around with those values to see if we can get anything from there.
Sometimes this can be an easy win, and can leave us with more information then we should've had to begin with.

Update role, refresh page, repeat.

Doing this, we would've mapped out the session management of cookies within this website.

Given what I am currently doing, I could report that cookies have excessive session lifetimes.

We could also investigate further:
Access to API endpoints.
Web application logs for accountability of actions.
