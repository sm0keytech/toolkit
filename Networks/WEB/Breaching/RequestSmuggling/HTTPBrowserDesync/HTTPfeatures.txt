Http keep-alive: allows the re usage of one tcp connection rather than having to use more than one. If caching features are in place, then cache poisoning could
take place within this allowing attackers to exploit it.

Http pipelining: If pipelining is enabled within the backend server of a program, then it will allow the simultanous sending of two requests with the corresponding 
responses without waiting for each resposne. The only way to differentiate between two requests and a big one is by using the Content-Length header, which specifies the length in bytes of each request. The content header is an unnecessary header for most static file contents in a web application, like images or icons, since the backend server will usually not consider it.
