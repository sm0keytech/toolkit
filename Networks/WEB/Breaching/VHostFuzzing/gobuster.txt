Gobuster (Faster Than FFUF for DNS Enumeration)
Gobuster is mainly used for subdomain enumeration, but it can fuzz vhosts using its DNS mode.

gobuster vhost -u target.com -w vhosts.txt
vhost → Uses vhost enumeration mode.
-u target.com → The main domain.
-w vhosts.txt → Wordlist of potential subdomains.

If a custom DNS resolver is needed:
gobuster vhost -u target.com -w vhosts.txt -r 8.8.8.8
