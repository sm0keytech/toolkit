This is used to enumerate the certificates within AD to see if there are 
any that can be manipulated with poisonous parameter combinations.

Need to do some more research on this, but here is a basic one:

Client Authentication - The certificate can be used for Client Authentication.
CT_FLAG_ENROLLEE_SUPPLIES_SUBJECT - The certificate template allows us to specify the Subject Alternative Name (SAN).
CTPRIVATEKEY_FLAG_EXPORTABLE_KEY - The certificate will be exportable with the private key.
Certificate Permissions - We have the required permissions to use the certificate template.


PowerShell command:
certutil -Template -v > templates.txt
