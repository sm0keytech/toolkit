Flash-based CSRF
The term "Flash-based CSRF" describes the technique of conducting a CSRF attack by taking advantage of flaws in Adobe Flash Player components. Internet applications with features like interactive content, video streaming, and intricate animationsflash based csrf have been made possible with Flash. But over time, security flaws in Flash, particularly those that can be used to launch CSRF attacks, have become a major source of worry. As HTML5 technology advanced and security flaws multiplied, official support for Adobe Flash Player ceased on December 31, 2020.

Even though Flash is no longer supported, a talk about Flash-based cross-site request forgery threats is instructive, particularly for legacy systems that still rely on antiquated technologies. A malicious Flash file (.swf) posted on the attacker's website would typically send unauthorised requests to other websites to carry out Flash-based CSRF attacks.
