for this, you can use:

SSTImap is a tool that automates the process of testing and exploiting SSTI vulnerabilities in various template engines. Hosted on GitHub, it provides a framework for discovering template injection flaws.
If you're using AttackBox, the tool is installed in /opt/SSTImap directory. If you're using your own machine, you can install it by cloning the repository from GitHub and setting up its environment. Here's how you can get started:

git clone https://github.com/vladko312/SSTImap.git
cd SSTImap
pip install -r requirements.txt

~~if this doesnt work, consult the impacket stuff, im sure its a similar install.

SSTImap is capable of the following:

Template Engine Detection: SSTImap can help identify the template engine used by a web application, which is crucial for crafting specific exploits.
Automated Exploitation: For known vulnerabilities, SSTImap can automate the process of exploiting them.

You can use SSTImap by providing it with the target URL and any necessary options. Hereâ€™s a simple usage example:

python3 sstimap.py -X POST -u 'http://ssti.thm:8002/mako/' -d 'page='
This command attempts to detect the SSTI vulnerability using tailored payloads.
