After a nice little bit of recon, you can spot that you can generic write 
a member to an AD group to leverage and elevate privileges within the 
system. 

We can do this in powershell with this nice syntax below:

Add-ADGroupMember "IT Support" -Members "sarah.hilton"

Then, we can check that we have been added with:

Get-ADGroupMember -Identity "IT Support"
And after sifting through, we can see our member has been added!
