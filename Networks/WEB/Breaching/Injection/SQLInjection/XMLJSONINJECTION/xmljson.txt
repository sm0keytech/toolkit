XML and JSON Injection 

Applications that parse XML or JSON data and use the parsed data in SQL queries can be vulnerable to injection if they do not properly sanitise the inputs. 
involves injecting malicious data into XML or JSON structures that are then used in SQL queries. This can occur if the application directly uses parsed values in SQL statements.

{
  "username": "admin' OR '1'='1--",
  "password": "password"
}

If the application uses these values directly in a SQL query like SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = 'admin' OR '1'='1'-- AND password = 'password', it could result in an injection.
