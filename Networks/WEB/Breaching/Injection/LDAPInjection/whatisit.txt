LDAP, which stands for Lightweight Directory Access Protocol, is a widely used protocol for accessing and maintaining distributed directory information services over an Internet Protocol (IP) network. LDAP enables organizations to manage users centrally, as well as groups and other directory information, often used for authentication and authorization purposes in web and internal applications.
