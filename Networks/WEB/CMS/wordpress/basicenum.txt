So, for wordpress sites, make sure to do deep directory brute forcing. This means not just doing the basic http server, but then following up on the links.

http://wordpresssite/blog/admin (not the actual link but kinda it) was found using deep directory brute forcing, so make sure to do all the enum possible or you
will definitely miss things.

once you find a login portal, another thing with wordpress is that it is very common for it to disclose usernames through saying "this is the wrong password for this
username".
