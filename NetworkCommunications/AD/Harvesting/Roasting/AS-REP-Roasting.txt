AS-REP Roasting is the technique that enables the attacker to retrieve password hashes for AD users whose account options have been set to "Do not require Kerberos pre-authentication".
This option relies on the old Kerberos authentication protocol, which allows authentication without a password.
Once we obtain the hashes, we can try to crack it offline, and finally, if it is crackable, we got a password!

Before performing the roasting, we need to gather a list of the accounts which should be gathered from the enumeration step.

Put them in a txt list like:

james
cat
dog
owl

We will be using the Impacket Get-NPUsers script this time as follows,
python3.9 /opt/impacket/examples/GetNPUsers.py -dc-ip 10.10.207.157 thm.red/ -usersfile /tmp/users.txt

We specified the IP address of the domain controller with the -dc-ip argument and provided a list of domain users to check against.
Once the tool finds the right user with no preauthentication configuration, it will generate the ticket.

Various cybersecurity and hacking tools also allow cracking the TGTs harvested from Active Directory, including Rubeus and Hashcat. 
Impacket GetNPUsers has the option to export tickets as John or hashcat format using the -format argument.
