Injection Fundamentals
LDAP Injection is a critical security vulnerability that occurs when user input is not properly sanitized before being incorporated into LDAP queries. This oversight allows attackers to manipulate these queries, leading to unauthorized access or manipulation of the LDAP directory data.

LDAP Injection exploits the way web applications construct LDAP queries. When user input is directly included in these queries without proper validation or encoding, attackers can inject malicious LDAP statements. This can result in unauthorized access to sensitive information, modification of directory data, or bypassing authentication mechanisms.

The process is analogous to SQL Injection, where malicious SQL statements are injected into queries to manipulate database operations. In LDAP Injection, the malicious code targets LDAP queries instead.

Common Attack Vectors
Authentication Bypass: Modifying LDAP authentication queries to log in as another user without knowing their password.
Unauthorized Data Access: Altering LDAP search queries to retrieve sensitive information not intended for the attacker's access.
Data Manipulation: Injecting queries that modify the LDAP directory, such as adding or modifying user attributes.

Injection Process
Making an LDAP Injection attack involves several key steps, from identifying the injection point to successfully exploiting the vulnerability.

This diagram illustrates the interaction between the attacker, the web application, and the LDAP server during an LDAP Injection attack. The attacker submits malicious input to the web application login form, which constructs an LDAP query incorporating this input. The LDAP server then executes the altered query, leading to potential unauthorized access or information disclosure, depending on the nature of the injected payload.
