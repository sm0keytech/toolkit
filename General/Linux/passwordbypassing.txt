inside a terminal which is not interactive, in order to get through a password prompt, you can do the following:

$Password = ConvertTo-SecureString "password123" -AsPlainText -Force
$Credential = New-Object System.Management.Automation.PSCredential ("Administrator", $Password)
Start-Process "cmd.exe" -Credential $Credential
