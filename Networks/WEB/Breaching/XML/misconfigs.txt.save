Avoiding Misconfigurations
Misconfigurations in XML parser settings are a common cause of XXE-related vulnerabilities. Adjusting these settings can significantly reduce the risk of XXE attacks. Below are detailed guidelines and best practices for several popular programming languages and frameworks.

General Best Practices
Disable External Entities and DTDs: As a best practice, disable the processing of external entities and DTDs in your XML parsers. Most XXE vulnerabilities arise from malicious DTDs.
Use Less Complex Data Formats: Where possible, consider using simpler data formats like JSON, which do not allow the specification of external entities.
Allowlisting Input Validation: Validate all incoming data against a strict schema that defines expected data types and patterns. Exclude or escape XML-specific characters such as <, >, &, ', and ". These characters are crucial in XML syntax and can lead to injection attacks if misused.

Mitigation Techniques in Popular Languages

Java
Use the DocumentBuilderFactory and disable DTDs:
DocumentBuilderFactory dbf = DocumentBuilderFactory.newInstance();
dbf.setFeature("http://apache.org/xml/features/disallow-doctype-decl", true);
dbf.setFeature("http://xml.org/sax/features/external-general-entities", false);
dbf.setFeature("http://xml.org/sax/features/external-parameter-entities", false);
dbf.setFeature("http://apache.org/xml/features/nonvalidating/load-external-dtd", false);
dbf.setXIncludeAware(false);
dbf.setExpandEntityReferences(false);
DocumentBuilder db = dbf.newDocumentBuilder();

.NET
Configure XML readers to ignore DTDs and external entities:
XmlReaderSettings settings = new XmlReaderSettings();
settings.DtdProcessing = DtdProcessing.Prohibit;
settings.XmlResolver = null;
XmlReader reader = XmlReader.Create(stream, settings);

PHP
Disable loading external entities by libxml:
libxml_disable_entity_loader(true);

Python
Use defusedxml library, which is designed to mitigate XML vulnerabilities:
from defusedxml.ElementTree import parse
et = parse(xml_input)

Regularly Update and Patch
Software Updates: Keep all XML processors and libraries up-to-date. Vendors frequently patch known vulnerabilities.
Security Patches: Regularly apply security patches to web applications and their environments.

Security Awareness and Code Reviews
Conduct Code Reviews: Regularly review code for security vulnerabilities, especially code that handles XML input and parsing.
Promote Security Training: Ensure developers are aware of secure coding practices, including the risks associated with XML parsing.
