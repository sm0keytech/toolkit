Traditional CSRF

Conventional CSRF attacks frequently concentrate on state-changing actions carried out by submitting forms. The victim is tricked into submitting a form without realising the associated data like cookies, URL parameters, etc. The victim's web browser sends an HTTP request to a web application form where the victim has already been authenticated. These forms are made to transfer money, modify account information, or alter an email address.

The above diagram shows traditional CSRF examples in the following steps:
The victim is already logged on to his bank website. The attackers create a crafted malicious link and email it to the victim.
The victim opens the email in the same browser.
Once clicked, the malicious link enables the auto-transfer of the amount from the victim's browser to the attacker's bank account.
