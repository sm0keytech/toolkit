There are two main types of tickets when it comes to kerberos tickets:

Gold: This is when we have a forged TGT. We can now request a TGT for 
almost any service we want at all. 

In order to forge our golden ticket, we need the password hash for the
kerberos golden ticket so we can sign a ticket for any user account that
we want.

By default, the krbtgt's password is never changed, meaning that we will
always have access to the password unless the password is rotated.

The blue team would have to rotate it twice to deny us access, since current
and previous passwords are kept valid for the account; this is to ensure
that the accidental rotation of the password would not affect any sort of 
services.

Apart from the KRBTGT's password hash, we need the domain name,domain SID,
and user ID for the person that we want to impersonate. If we can recover
the password hash, then we are already in a position where we can recover
the information.

Silver: This is a worse off version of the gold, usually comes when you've
hit some lateral movement but are still in the early feats of exploitation.

Silver tickets are forged TGS tickets. So, we would just be interfacing
with the service we want to interact with directly. Some pointers:

- Silver tickets are generated by the machine account of the host we are
targeting.

- The difference between silver and gold is the number of privileges
we acquire from getting the ticket.

- Since the TGS is forged, there is no associated TGT, meaning that the 
DC was never contacted. This makes the attack incredibly dangerous, 
as the only available logs would be on the targeted server.

- Since permissions are determined through SIDs, we can create a non-existing
user for our silver ticket that would place the user in the local admin group.

- A machine password is usually rotated every 30 days, meaning that we don't
have very much persistence, meaning this is a good start, but definitely 
not the end goal.
