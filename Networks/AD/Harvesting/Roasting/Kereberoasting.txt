Kerberoasting is a common AD attack to obtain AD tickets that helps with persistence.
In order for this attack to work, an adversary must have access to SPN (Service Principal Name) accounts such as IIS User, MSSQL, etc.
The Kerberoasting attack involves requesting a Ticket Granting Ticket (TGT) and Ticket Granting Service (TGS). 

This attack's end goal is to enable privilege escalation and lateral network movement. 

Let's do a quick demo about the attack. First, we need to find an SPN account(s), and then we can send a request to get a TGS ticket.
We will perform the Kerberoasting attack from the AttackBox using the GetUserSPNs.py python script.

Remember to use the THM.red/thm account with Passw0rd! as a password. (This is our example)
python3.9 /opt/impacket/examples/GetUserSPNs.py -dc-ip 10.10.207.157 THM.red/thm

The previous command is straightforward: we provide the Domain Controller IP address and the domain name\username. 
Then the GetUserSPNs script asks for the user's password to retrieve the required information.
The output revealed that we have an SPN account, svc-user. Once we find the SPN user, we can send a single request to get a TGS ticket for the srv-user user using the -request-user argument.

python3.9 /opt/impacket/examples/GetUserSPNs.py -dc-ip 10.10.207.157 THM.red/thm -request-user svc-user 

Now, it is a matter of cracking the obtained TGS ticket using the HashCat tool using -m 13100 mode as follows
hashcat -a 0 -m 13100 spn.hash /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt
