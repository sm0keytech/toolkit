Firstly, when we are trying to SAM harvest to get hashes, we need to 
ensure that we dont have access to the database, as this could save
us a LOT of time trying to bypass something that doesn't even have
a lock.

SAM = Security Account Manager btw 

Run this command:
c:\Windows\System32\config\sam

If we can access the directory, we could read / copy it and then 
take it home with us for offline cracking or PTH attacks with mimikatz.
