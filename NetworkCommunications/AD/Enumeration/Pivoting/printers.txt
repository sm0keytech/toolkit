Here, we could use a printer as a pivot point within a network in order 
to get into a server. This is done through an enumeration command and 
a server to ensure that we are able to get into the printer and thus then
pivot into the server we want to get access to.

GWMI Win32_Printer -Computer thmserver2.za.tryhackme.loc

This is checking whether we have a printer that we can pivot to.

If you get an access denied error, you can also try:

Get-PrinterPort -ComputerName thmserver2.za.tryhackme.loc

If both don't work, sometimes you just have to take a leap of faith
in order to get into the network you want to get into.

We then want to ensure that SMB signing is not enforced. We can do this 
through a simple NMAP scan:

nmap --script=smb2-security-mode -p445 thmserver1.za.tryhackme.loc thmserver2.za.tryhackme.loc

If signing is enforced, we are cooked. If signing is allowed but not enforced,
we are good to go.
