So, had some trouble with neo4j and its getting a little bit annoying.

I need to find a better way to clean the database, but for now:

Just do the reinstall if needed:

sudo apt-get remove --purge neo4j

and then, reinstall:

sudo apt-get install neo4j

then credentials will be 
neo4j
neo4j
respectively

upon new launch.
