Mitigating the risks associated with prototype pollution is crucial for both pentesters and secure code developers, as the vulnerability enables attackers to manipulate an object's prototype, potentially leading to unexpected behaviour and security issues. Here are some mitigation measures for prototype pollution:

Pentesters
Input Fuzzing and Manipulation: Interact with user inputs extensively, especially those used to interact with prototype-based structures, and fuzz them with a variety of payloads. Look for scenarios where untrusted data can lead to prototype pollution.
Context Analysis and Payload Injection: Analyse the application's codebase to understand how user inputs are used within prototype-based structures. Inject payloads into these contexts to test for prototype pollution vulnerabilities.
CSP Bypass and Payload Injection: Evaluate the effectiveness of security headers such as CSP in mitigating prototype pollution. Attempt to bypass CSP restrictions and inject payloads to manipulate prototypes.
Dependency Analysis and Exploitation: Conduct a thorough analysis of third-party libraries and dependencies used by the application. Identify outdated or vulnerable libraries that may introduce prototype pollution vulnerabilities. Exploit these vulnerabilities to manipulate prototypes and gain unauthorised access or perform other malicious actions.
Static Code Analysis: Use static code analysis tools to identify potential prototype pollution vulnerabilities during the development phase. These tools can provide insights into insecure coding patterns and potential security risks.

Secure Code Developers
Avoid Using __proto__: Refrain from using the __proto__ property as it is mosltly susceptible to prototype pollution. Instead, use Object.getPrototypeOf() to access the prototype of an object in a safer manner.
Immutable Objects: Design objects to be immutable when possible. This prevents unintended modifications to the prototype, reducing the impact of prototype pollution vulnerabilities.
Encapsulation: Encapsulate objects and their functionalities, exposing only necessary interfaces. This can help prevent unauthorised access to object prototypes.
Use Safe Defaults: When creating objects, establish safe default values and avoid relying on user inputs to set prototype properties. Initialise objects securely to minimise the risk of pollution.
Input Sanitisation: Sanitise and validate user inputs thoroughly. Be cautious when using user-controlled data to modify object prototypes. Apply strict input validation practices to mitigate injection risks.
Dependency Management: Regularly update and monitor dependencies. Choose well-maintained libraries and frameworks, and stay informed about any security updates or patches related to prototype pollution.
Security Headers: Implement security headers such as Content Security Policy (CSP) to control the sources from which resources can be loaded. This can help mitigate the risk of loading malicious scripts that manipulate prototypes.

By combining rigorous testing practices, secure coding principles, and ongoing security awareness, both pentesters and secure code developers can contribute to the effective mitigation of Prototype Pollution vulnerabilities in applications. Regularly updating knowledge on emerging threats and vulnerabilities is essential to avoid potential risks.
