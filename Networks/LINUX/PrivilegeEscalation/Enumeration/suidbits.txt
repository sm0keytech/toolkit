so, if we are looking for binaries, a lot of the time we can be looking for suid bits within binaries in order to execute and exploit the file to escalate.

find suid files:
find / -perm -4000 -type f 2>/dev/null

find set group id files:
find / -perm -2000 -type f 2>/dev/null

find writeable suid/sgid files:
find / -perm -4002 -type f 2>/dev/null

find sgid files that are world writeable:
find / -perm -2002 -type f 2>/dev/null

check perms of a specific file:
ls -l /path/to/file

heres an exmaple:
-rwsr-xr-x 1 root root 23456 Feb 20 10:00 /usr/bin/passwd
we can see a suid bit is set through the s in rws at the beginning 

so if you are in a directory, or need to find whether its writeable so you can place a payload, check with the following commands:
ls -ld /var/tmp/*
or just ls -ld  if youre in the directory

if it returns with something like:
drwxrwxrwt (world writeable with a sticky bit) or
drwxrwxr-x

check specific folders for read / write bits:
ls -la /var/tmp/systemd-private-*/ 2>/dev/null
