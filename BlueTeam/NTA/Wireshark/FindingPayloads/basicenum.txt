detecting executable transfer (b64, exe, etc):
frame contains "mz"

always check dns, http.request, http.response, smb, smb2, ftp


frame contains "powershell"
look for powershell

file > export objects to see if there are any objects. usually good things in here

dns.qry.name contains "github.com"
check github stuff

following http and tcp streams are great

netcat reverse shells tranfer everything inside of plaintext so good to intercept
once you find the port follow the tcp stream and youll find all the data
