this is the holes in the code for some of these MFA applications:

Weak OTP Generation Algorithms
The security of a One-Time Password (OTP) is only as strong as the algorithm used to create it.

Application Leaking the 2FA Token
If an application handles data poorly or has vulnerabilities like insecure API endpoints, it might accidentally leak the 2FA token in the application's HTTP response.

Brute Forcing the OTP
Even though OTPs are designed for one-time use, they aren't immune to brute-force attacks. 

Lack of Rate Limiting
Without proper rate limiting, an application is open to attackers to keep trying different OTPs without difficulty.
