For this, you need to do a few different things:

- Execute the bloodhound binary on the victim machine in order to gather
the information needed to enumerate AD.
- Install bloodhound & neo4j on attacker machine.
- Setup Neo4j server and configure the password at the address:
http://localhost:7474

Then, run bloodhound as the following command:
bloodhound --no-sandbox

Once the bloodhound binary has finished being executed, scp it to your 
local attackbox and then drag & drop the ZIP file into the bloodhound 
neo4j database.

From here, you can see loads of enumeration about the AD system.

Remember, its really good, but its also really loud.

You also need to find a bloodhound binary (I think mainly they are exe)
to run on the target system.

To clean the database, if neo4j was installed with the APT package manager
it will be located under /etc/neo4j/data/databases

Go and just remove the "neo4j" or whatever the name is database and 
restart the service.
