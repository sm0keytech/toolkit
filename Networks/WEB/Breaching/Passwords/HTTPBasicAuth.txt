Authorisation header format:
Authorization: Basic <credentials>
where <credentials> is the base64 encoding of username:password.


Input any username and password in the pop-up and capture the Basic Auth Request using Burp.
Right-click the request and send it to Intruder.
In Burp Intruder, go to the "Positions" tab and decode the base64 encoded string in the Authorization header.
Once decoded, highlight the decoded string and click the Add button in the top right corner.
Next is configuring the payloads. Go to the Payloads tab and set the payload type to Simple list and choose your preferred wordlist.

Since the header is base64 encoded, we need to add two rules in the Payload processing section. The first automatically adds a username to the password, so instead of 123456, the payload will be "admin:123456".
payloads > add payload processing rule > add prexit > admin:

The second rule will base64 encode the combined username and password from the supplied list.
payloads > add payload processing rule > encoding > base64 encoded

We should also remove the character "=" (equal sign) from the encoding because base64 uses "=" for padding. To do this, scroll down and remove the "=" sign from the list of characters in the Payload encoding section.

Once you get a Status code 200, it means the brute force is successful, and one of the passwords in the supplied list is working. Decode the encoded base64 string in the successful request.
