for wordpress, again its in themes that we can use to create a reverse shell.

appearance > theme editor

then select the text and replace it with a php reverse shell 
(in a real world environment you would just want to add maybe a simple php command shell on top instead of deleting everything)

do it on somewhere which wont affect it too much, rn im choosing the 404 template which is pretty good idea.

then, go to the website inside of the network:
