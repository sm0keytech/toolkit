To dump any running Windows process using the GUI, open the Task Manager, and from the Details tab, find the required process, right-click on it, and select "Create dump file".

You can dump the lsass process in order to try to get some information from it.

Once the dumping process is finished, a pop-up message will show containing the path of the dumped file. Now copy the file and transfer it to the AttackBox to extract NTLM hashes offline.

Copy the dumped process to the Mimikatz folder.
C:\Users\Administrator>copy C:\Users\ADMINI~1\AppData\Local\Temp\2\lsass.DMP C:\Tools\Mimikatz\lsass.DMP

Note: this might not work if there is a "protected lsass" value inside of the registry.
