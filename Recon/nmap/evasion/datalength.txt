packet fragmentation is decent for evasion

nmap tcp scans are 24 bytes total. if you want to limit each packet size
to 8 bytes, then you can use:

-f within the nmap command. example:
nmap -sS -Pn -f -F machine_ip.

-ff fragments packets to 16 bytes, so you would have 1 packet at 16 bytes
and 1 packet at 8 bytes to make up the 24 byte total packet.

the packet will then split into 3 different packets which will be sent
over the network.

maximum transmission unit can also split the packet. some devices like 
ethernet have a MTU of 1500.

running nmap with --mtu 8 will be the same as running nmap with -f.
you need to add the ip header size to the packet length, which gives
you the size of the packet. the minimum size of a IP header is generally
20. 

length of MTU should always be a multiple of 8.

--data-length does data (again needs to be a multiple of 8) in a 
specific format to ensure that the packets are always the same size,
and adds padding if they are not.

--data-length 64 will add extra padding if needs be to get the length
of the data within the packet to 64.
