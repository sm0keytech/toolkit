Ntdsutil

Ntdsutil is a Windows utility to used manage and maintain Active Directory configurations. It can be used in various scenarios such as 

Restore deleted objects in Active Directory.
Perform maintenance for the AD database.
Active Directory snapshot management.
Set Directory Services Restore Mode (DSRM) administrator passwords.

Local Dumping (No Credentials)
This is usually done if you have no credentials available but have administrator access to the domain controller. 
Therefore, we will be relying on Windows utilities to dump the NTDS file and crack them offline. As a requirement, first, we assume we have administrator access to a domain controller. 
As a requirement, first, we assume we have administrator access to a domain controller. 

To successfully dump the content of the NTDS file we need the following files:
C:\Windows\NTDS\ntds.dit
C:\Windows\System32\config\SYSTEM
C:\Windows\System32\config\SECURITY

The following is a one-liner PowerShell command to dump the NTDS file using the Ntdsutil tool in the C:\temp directory.
powershell "ntdsutil.exe 'ac i ntds' 'ifm' 'create full c:\temp' q q"

Now, if we check the c:\temp directory, we see two folders: Active Directory and registry, which contain the three files we need.
Transfer these to the attackbox and then run secretsdump.py on them.
