so for this, we need a set of credentials with admin access to a domain controller or special permsisions.

DC Sync (domain controller sync)

this is a popular attack to perform inside of systems inside an active directory environment to dump credentials remotely.
this attack works when an account (special account with necessary perms) or an AD admin account is compromised that has the following AD permissions:

Replicating Directory Changes
Replicating Directory Changes All
Replicating Directory Changes in Filtered Set

An adversary takes advantage of these configurations to perform domain replication, commonly referred to as "DC Sync", or Domain Controller Sync. 

We could do this inside of mimikatz, and we have before. its inside mimikatz of harvesting credentials. but, we will use impacket for this example.

python3.9 /opt/impacket/examples/secretsdump.py -just-dc THM.red/<AD_Admin_User>@10.10.97.26 
the -just-dc argument is for extracting the NTDS data.
the thm.red/AD_Admin_User is the authenticated domain user in the form of (domain/user).

Note if we are interested to dump only the NTLM hashes, then we can use the -just-dc-ntlm argument as follows,
python3.9 /opt/impacket/examples/secretsdump.py -just-dc-ntlm THM.red/<AD_Admin_User>@10.10.97.26

Once we obtained hashes, we can either use the hash for a specific user to impersonate him or crack the hash using Cracking tools, such hashcat. We can use the hashcat -m 1000 mode to crack the Windows NTLM hashes as follows:
hashcat -m 1000 -a 0 /path/to/ntlm_hashes.txt /path/to/wordlist/such/as/rockyou.txt
