In LDAP, directory entries are structured as objects, each adhering to a specific schema that defines the rules and attributes applicable to the object. This object-oriented approach ensures consistency and governs how objects like users or groups can be represented and manipulated within the directory.

Services that use LDAP:

Microsoft Active Directory: A service for Windows domain networks, utilizing LDAP as part of its underlying protocol suite to manage domain resources.
OpenLDAP: An open-source implementation of LDAP, widely used for managing user information and supporting authentication mechanisms across various platforms.

LDIF Format
LDAP entries can be represented using the LDAP Data Interchange Format (LDIF), a standard plain text data format for representing LDAP directory entries and update operations. LDIF imports and exports directory contents and describes directory modifications such as adding, modifying, or deleting entries.

Structure
An LDAP directory follows a hierarchical structure like a file system's tree. This structure comprises various entries representing a unique item, such as a user, group, or resource.

At the top of the LDAP tree, we find the top-level domain (TLD), such as dc=ldap,dc=thm. Beneath the TLD, there may be subdomains or organizational units (OUs), such as ou=people or ou=groups, which further categorize the directory entries.

Distinguished Names (DNs): Serve as unique identifiers for each entry in the directory, specifying the path from the top of the LDAP tree to the entry, for example, cn=John Doe,ou=people,dc=example,dc=com.
Relative Distinguished Names (RDNs): Represent individual levels within the directory hierarchy, such as cn=John Doe, where cn stands for Common Name.
Attributes: Define the properties of directory entries, like mail=john@example.com for an email address.
