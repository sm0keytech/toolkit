Basics of File Inclusion
A traversal string, commonly seen as ../, is used in path traversal attacks to navigate through the directory structure of a file system. It's essentially a way to move up one directory level. Traversal strings are used to access files outside the intended directory.
Relative pathing refers to locating files based on the current directory. For example, include('./folder/file.php') implies that file.php is located inside a folder named folder, which is in the same directory as the executing script.
Absolute pathing involves specifying the complete path starting from the root directory. For example, /var/www/html/folder/file.php is an absolute path.
