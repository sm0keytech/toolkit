Powersploit has some really useful features for further enumeration so we can
go further into the system for more details etc. Thats why its used everywhere.

Here's an example of how to run powersploit so it works correctly:

(Assuming you've got the ps1 inside of the system inside a decent spot)
(Also this is in a powershell shell)

Import-Module C:\Tools\PowerView.ps1 
(Imports the module from tools which you added to somewhere, tools is an
example)

Get-NetUser -TrustedToAuth
(For kereberos exploitation, to see if we can get anywhere thru there)
