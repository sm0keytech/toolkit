These commands are to enumerate Active Directory groups.

Starting off with the most simple command, listing all of the groups:
Get-ADGroup -Filter * | Select-Object Name

Then, you can see inside of a group using the command:
Get-ADGroup -Identity "Tier 2 Admins" -Properties *

You can see who is in a group with the command:
Get-ADGroupMembers -Identity "Tier 2 Admins"
