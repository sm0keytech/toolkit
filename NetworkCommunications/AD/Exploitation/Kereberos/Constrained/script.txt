this is an example of how it can be done:

firstly, import the powersploit module thats needed to enumerate the system:
Import-Module C:\Tools\PowerView.ps1 

Then, execute enumeration:
Get-NetUser -TrustedToAuth

This finds all the users that are trusted to auth (wow).

You could perform some nice proper post exploitation using mimikatz.
(Inisde the Post-Expl module).

Then, use mimikatz to try and find some sort of service to exploit.
I managed to find this service called winIIC to exploit, which
gave me a plaintext password which was nice through mimikatz.

commands for mimikatz are within the post exploitation module.
theyre in the one which mentions about ensuring to exit if doing
kereberos ticket stuff.

now, here is where we need to use kekeo to generate ourselves a 
kereberos authentication ticket.

first, run kekeo.exe
then, the syntax:
tgt::ask /user:svcIIS /domain:za.tryhackme.loc /password:redacted
