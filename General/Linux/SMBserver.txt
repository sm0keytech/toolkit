to setup an smb server, use the following commands:

python3 smbserver.py -smb2support -comment "My Logs Server" -debug logs /tmp
You can access the contents of the network share by entering the command smbclient //ATTACKBOX_IP/logs -U guest -N. This would allow you to connect to the network share, and then you can issue the command ls to list all the commands.
