so, its actually pretty simple.
firstly, act like you are going to transfer some money.

get the transfer request into burp, then send it to repeater.
then, make a new group in burp under the + tab. add the one request to it.
then, once the group is made, right click the request, duplicate it maybe 20 times.
add the money in, then select the drop down arrow by send, and send it in whatever sequence you'd like to.

pretty simple!
