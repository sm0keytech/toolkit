so this is the 
local administrator password solution (LAPS)
this will explain how to enumerate and obtain a LAPS.



Group Policy Preferences (GPP)
A Windows OS has a built-in Administrator account which can be accessed using a password. Changing passwords in a large Windows environment with many computers is challenging. Therefore, Microsoft implemented a method to change local administrator accounts across workstations using Group Policy Preferences (GPP).

GPP is a tool that allows administrators to create domain policies with embedded credentials. Once the GPP is deployed, different XML files are created in the SYSVOL folder. SYSVOL is an essential component of Active Directory and creates a shared directory on an NTFS volume that all authenticated domain users can access with reading permission.
The issue was the GPP relevant XML files contained a password encrypted using AES-256 bit encryption. At that time, the encryption was good enough until Microsoft somehow published its private key on MSDN. Since Domain users can read the content of the SYSVOL folder, it becomes easy to decrypt the stored passwords. One of the tools to crack the SYSVOL encrypted password is Get-GPPPassword.

Local Administrator Password Solution (LAPS)
In 2015, Microsoft removed storing the encrypted password in the SYSVOL folder. It introduced the Local Administrator Password Solution (LAPS), which offers a much more secure approach to remotely managing the local administrator password.

The new method includes two new attributes (ms-mcs-AdmPwd and ms-mcs-AdmPwdExpirationTime) of computer objects in the Active Directory. The ms-mcs-AdmPwd attribute contains a clear-text password of the local administrator, while the ms-mcs-AdmPwdExpirationTime contains the expiration time to reset the password. LAPS uses admpwd.dll to change the local administrator password and update the value of ms-mcs-AdmPwd
