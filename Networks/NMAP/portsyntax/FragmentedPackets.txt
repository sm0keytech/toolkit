Fragmented packets can help to evade a firewall.
-f is to fragment the packets.

Adding another -f (-f -f or -ff) will split the data into 16 byte-fragments instead of 8.
You can change the default value by using the --mtu; however, you should always choose a multiple of 8.

On the other hand, if you prefer to increase the size of your packets to make them look innocuous, you can use the option --data-length NUM, where num specifies the number of bytes you want to append to your packets.
