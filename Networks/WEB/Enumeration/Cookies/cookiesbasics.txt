So, for this, we are looking at cookies inside of websites. 
This has a lot of function, but mainly, we are trying to enumerate cookies to see 
how they behave inside of a website to see if we can abuse cookies in any sort of way.

Here, we need to check the session management life cycle:
Session Creation >
Session Tracking >
Session Expiry >
Session Termination

Cookies generally relate to one of these 4 different session values.

Now, to understand common vulnerabilities, we should look at the difference between Authentication and Authorisation:

Identification: Identification is the process of verifying who the user is. Mainly done through usernames. Every website needs a unique identifier for each person.
Email address, or username, or something must differ person from other person.

Authentication: Authentication is the process of ensuring that the user is who they say they are. Where in identification, you provide a username, for authentication, you provide proof that you are who you say you are.
For example, you can supply the password associated with the claimed username. The web application can confirm this information if it is valid; this is the point where session creation would kick in.

Authorisation: Authorisation is the process of ensuring that the specific user has the rights required to perform the action requested. 
For example, while all users may view data, only a select few may modify it. In the session management lifecycle, session tracking plays a critical role in authorisation.

Accountability: Accountability is the process of creating a record of the actions performed by users. We should track the user's session and log all actions performed using the specific session.
This information plays a critical role in the event of a security incident to piece together what has happened.
